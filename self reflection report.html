    <h1>Self-Reflection Report</h1>
    
    <h2>Personal Background</h2>
    <h3>Childhood and Upbringing</h3>
    <p>My childhood was quite normal and uneventful. I was born in Romania and lived there until the age of seven. During this period, I had a few Arab friends, which helped me feel connected to my roots even while living abroad.</p>
    
    <h3>Influences and Personal Growth</h3>
    <p>During my teenage years, my friends often remarked on my odd behavior, which pushed me to reflect and improve my personality. This phase was crucial in shaping who I am today.</p>
    
    <h3>Core Values</h3>
    <p>I firmly believe that discipline and hard work are essential values. These principles are the foundation for achieving goals and earning respect wherever one goes.</p>
    
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <h3>Choice of Field</h3>
    <p>I chose to study computer science because I enjoy problem-solving and coding. These aspects of the field resonate with my interests and strengths.</p>
    
    <h3>University Experience</h3>
    <p>The most significant aspect of my university experience has been learning to abide by deadlines and work effectively in teams. These skills have been vital for my academic success and personal growth.</p>
    
    <h3>Challenging Academic Experiences</h3>
    <p>High school was particularly challenging for me. I faced numerous problems and often found myself in embarrassing situations. However, these experiences taught me valuable lessons in resilience and self-improvement.</p>
    
    <h3>Major Challenges</h3>
    <p>The biggest challenge I've faced so far was leaving the Lebanese University due to failure and starting over at Beirut Arab University. This was a pivotal moment in my life that required determination and hard work.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Growth and Development</h2>
    <h3>Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
    <p>One of my most significant strengths is anger management. In high school, I was very aggressive, but I have since learned how to calm myself down and avoid acting aggressively. Hard work is another strength, developed through various academic challenges. However, I still struggle with getting angry easily over trivial matters, although I manage not to show aggression towards others.</p>
    
    <h3>Stress Management</h3>
    <p>I manage stress by using various techniques to calm down and by distributing work equally among team members. This approach helps me maintain balance and stay focused.</p>
    
    <h2>Extracurricular Activities and Hobbies</h2>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Football with friends plays a crucial role in my life. It provides a much-needed break from academics and helps me stay physically active and socially connected.</p>
    
    <h3>Balance</h3>
    <p>I always prioritize studying over other activities, ensuring that my academic responsibilities are met before engaging in personal interests.</p>
    
    <h2>Social and Community Involvement</h2>
    <h3>Contribution to Community</h3>
    <p>I believe that the best way to contribute to my community is by being a successful person and demonstrating the quality of education I receive at my university. This serves as a testament to the institution's excellence and inspires others.</p>
    
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
    <h3>Professional Development Plan</h3>
